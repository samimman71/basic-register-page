    <p>Welcome to the first episode of our podcast series "Valley in the Making" - a series where we bring you real-life experiences, stories, and insights from inspiring tech minds. Discover what shaped them into the trailblazers they are today.

        In this episode, we feature Raghav, a seasoned Full-Stack Developer with over 9 years of experience in the tech industry. Raghavâ€™s journey is nothing short of fascinating:
        He started his career at Zoho, a company many dream of joining.
        He made a bold move to leave Zoho to work at a lesser-known startup. Why would anyone take such a step?
        Later, he transitioned to Vimeo, a renowned product-based company, where he continues to thrive.
        
        Through this episode, Raghav shares:
        His unique career decisions and what motivated him to take unconventional paths.
        An in-depth look at the evolution of Full-Stack Web Development over the last decade.
        A thoughtful discussion on AI's impact on Full-Stack Development - is AI a threat or an enabler for developers
